# SkillHub 🎓

SkillHub is a **Learning & Development (L&D) Management System** built with **Spring Boot 3.5, Spring Security (JWT), and ReactJS**.  
It’s designed to manage users, training programs, batches, schedules, and feedback — similar to how large organizations handle employee learning and development.
